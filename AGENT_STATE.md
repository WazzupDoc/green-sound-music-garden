Updated 2026-11-12, V58 draft. Removed layout-affecting hover padding in editorial service links; compositor-only text transform is limited to normal-motion/non-Lite. Added regression test. V57 PR #46 is a separate homepage poster redesign with only its visual QA run confirmed; do not merge it into the V48-clean editorial line without owner review. V56 and V55 exact-head CI unavailable from PR workflow query. PR #19 mergeable=false. No Lighthouse measurements or production merge. Next: exact-head CI, six-width screenshots, keyboard/reduced-motion/Lite behavior, Contact 2-service prefill, main deploy trigger/rollback audit.

Updated 2026-11-12, V56 draft. New keyboard focus-within visual chapter cue on existing editorial service links, CSS-only; guarded by a static Vitest test. V55 CI unverified; V53 live-stage PR #44 is a separate parallel redesign, not merged into this branch. PR #19 mergeable=false. No production merge. Scores remain unmeasured.

# AGENT STATE — Green Sound Music

Updated 2026-11-12, V55 draft. Baseline V54 PR #42 (draft, mergeable at last check, no exact-head CI runs returned); V53 PR #41. PR #19 remains unmergeable due to conflicts.

## Implemented
- V55 continuous editorial 01–08 running order via native CSS counters; no new homepage section or dependency.
- Corrected V54 image-path test to use literal prefix checking.
- Added source/license research, asset provenance, experiment gate and version documentation.

## Unverified
- TypeScript, SSR, Vitest, Chromium six-width, visual screenshots and CI for V55. No Lighthouse or field SEO scores measured.
- Main deployment trigger, backup tag/rollback permissions, and public production status. Main must remain unchanged.

## Next backlog
1. Confirm V55 exact-head CI and fix any failing tests, especially existing test runner imports.
2. Inspect screenshots at 360, 390, 430, 768, 1440, 1920 and ensure numbering reads 01–08 across chapters.
3. Audit Contact prefill (two services), hydration, focus, reduced-motion/Lite, Save-Data and keyboard Finder.
4. Verify true LCP element and image priority in staging before modifying eager/lazy flags.
5. Research actual local DJ/sound/lighting search intents without invented metrics; document only verified service area.
6. Inspect PR #19 conflict and main CI/CD deployment settings; do not merge without backup/tag and separate publication approval where needed.
